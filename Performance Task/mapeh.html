<h1>DECIDE MODEL</h1>
  
	<div class="grid-container">
   <h1 class = "decide" > D </h1>  - The institution's issue is a lack of resources
   and the requirement for 
  psychological evaluations.
  <br> </div> 
  <h3 > <div class="grid-container">
  <h1 class = "decide" > E </h1> - The initiative provides a cutting-edge, helpful program that is safe for the community and 
  satisfies its requirements. It is essential due to its intention to give the institution a green 
  area so that it can contribute to its resources and support the biodiversity and wellness of our
  communities. We suggest this program to give conversational guidance, webinars, as well as one-on-one
  discourse, with the goal of promoting a healthy mental condition. This would aid in the children's 
  growth and how they handle their problems and prior traumas. </div> </h3>
  <br>
	<h3 class = "decide"> <div class="grid-container">
  <h1 style = "decide"> C </h1>  - Composting services, counseling evaluations, selling goods to raise money for psychiatric examinations, and a project to produce fruits and vegetables are the four potential alternatives to this initiative. These may be utilized in place of the planned projects.
  <br> </div> </h3>
   <h3 class = "decide"> <div class="grid-container">
  <h1 style = "decide"> I </h1> - We believe that the counseling evaluations and the composting service are the greatest alternatives for our project. Because these 2 options can benefit both the institution and the SMAC children.
  <br> </div> </h3> 
   <h3 class = "decide"> <div class="grid-container">
  <h1 style = "decide"> D </h1>- The plan of action that we can create and carry out is to set up livelihood initiatives for the SMAC children. Such exercises that can enhance children's mental wellness.
  <br> </div> </h3> 
   <h3 class = "decide"> <div class="grid-container">
  <h1 style = "decide"> E </h1> - These evaluation questions will enable us to determine whether the program benefited both the institution and the SMAC youngsters. This can aid us in determining if the facility and the SMAC children still require assistance.
