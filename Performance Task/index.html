SMAC is a CHILD CARE INSTITUTION that focuses on caring for <br>abused, neglected, and abandoned children.</h2> 
<span><p class = "profiling-text" style = "align: center;padding: 10px 30px; font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.7; "> 
The institution places a priority on educating the children to be better in their life. 
Giving the kids psychological and physical assistance is another goal of the organization. </span>
 Up to this point, the SMAC Sisters Institution has accepted children in need and provided them with 
 assistance and guidance to develop into artistic individuals. The Sorelle Missionarie dell'Amore di
 Cristo, Inc. which is SMAC, have direct experience of the struggles 
 faced by several families, including those with children, to provide for their basic needs which got them 
 to formally establish the SMAC Institution on Saint Joseph's Day. The young children who are subjected to 
 violence and sexual abuse are those who are living in subpar conditions on the streets, suffering from starvation, 
 poor cleanliness, and low morale are being taken care by the institute. The goal of SMAC is to improve the standard 
 of care given to those kids by reorganizing its programs and formulating its services in order to set up the 
 center as a stand-alone institution.  </p>

“We need psychological assessment for the children but we can't afford to pay 
because this is too expensive. Not only for one session but until the kid fully recovers and will become mindful 
about all his/ her issues.”</h3>
