	<h1 class = "background" style = "text-align: left;"> Problem Statement</h1>
	
	<p> The issue in the institution is the lack of resources like food as 
	well as the need for  greenery added to their facility. For the children,
	we want to address the issue of the need for psychological assessment to 
	the children. With this in mind, our goal is to manage effectively their 
	troubles with the children and the institution’s facility. In order to 
	achieve that, we would come up with a proposed project solution. </p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "background-2">
	
	<h1 class = "background" style = "text-align: right;" > Problem Description </h1>
	
	<p> SMAC sister is an institution that provides for children that are 
	experiencing neglect and abandonment. In line with this, SMAC is experiencing 
	a shortage of resources and a lack of green spaces. On the other hand, 
	the children are in need of phycological assessments. The environment of
	SMAC would affect the well-being of the Institution’s members and the children 
	living in SMAC. Their food availability would also be put at risk seeing as 
	they are in scarcity. Additionally, they are unable to pay for the 
	psychological assessments since it is too expensive. Not only just for one 
	session but all the way up until the child is healed. Furthermore, several 
	of the kids in SMAC lack prior childhood experience. With the aforementioned 
	issues, we strive to provide a livelihood program for SMAC and its children. 
	It would cater to their needs and address their issues. We would lead hand in
	hand to do our best and deliver quality assistance for their benefit.</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "background-3">
	
    <h1 class = "background">Project summary</h1>
	
	<p> The problem of the partner institution is the lack of resources and the 
	lack for a sense of childhood of the children. The lack of resources may be 
	due to the scarcity of gardening or greenery activities. While the lack for a
	sense of childhood of the children may be due to the past experiences of the 
	children as they were neglected, abandoned, or orphaned. 
	<br> </br>
	This project kept in mind the mission of the SMAC institution, where it aims 
	to improve the lives of the children with traumatic past experiences and give 
	them a home with love and care. This project aims to address the identified 
	issues with proposed efficient project services.
	<br></br>
	First is the composting service, this helps the institution to have a 
	sustainable food source and to have a greener environment for the community.
	This composting service, with its greenery that is wished to achieve, can help
	create a sacred space for the children for prayers, and etc. The second
	proposed service is a counseling assessment, where the volunteers would have 
	a meaningful conversation and activities with the children to help with their
	development as they lack a sense of childhood. This service is also to help 
	them with their personal issues, traumas, and etc. 
	<br></br>
	With the planned project services, it is anticipated in the future that the 
	institution will have a better environment. As it is hoped that the institution
	would have a sustainable and healthy food source to add more greenery in
	their facility. As for the children, it is hoped that the services would help 
	them develop and understand themselves for the future ahead of them.

	<h1 class = "background"> Project Background </h1>
	
	<p> The SMAC institution’s mission is to improve the lives of neglected,
	abandoned, and orphaned children and to give them a home, solving this problem
	would help achieve that. As we aim to solve the lack of resources in the
	institution and the lack of sense of childhood in the children. The problem 
	of the children, started when the children were neglected, abandoned, and 
	orphaned, resulting in their lack of sense of childhood. As for the problem 
	of the institution, we saw that the facility lacks greenery and the institution
	needs sustainable food. </p>
	</div>
	
	<!-- Intervention --></!-->
	
	<div class = "background-5">
	<h1 class = "background"> Proposed Project </h1>
	
	<p> The well-being of the institution and its children is our utmost priority. 
	Our proposal for a Livelihood Program for SMAC will provide an efficient 
	solution to address the issues and needs of the institution. For SMAC 
	institution, we will execute a composting service and cater to their need for 
	more supply of food and green spaces. At the same time, we will deliver a 
	counselling/guidance program for the children where we will conduct instructive
	conversations that will broaden our understanding of their needs. Along with 
	this we will try and seek out professional psychologists in volunteering for 
	free sessions for the children to be mindful of their issues and help them 
	develop their well-being. Since there are limitations to this project, it will
	cater up until the school year. It will also be highly voluntary so all the 
	resources we need will seek out willing donors or providers. To ensure the 
	long-term effects of this program,  we will gather volunteers and build a 
	group of members that are inclined to continue this program. We will advertise
	and send out publication materials that will ensure others join and help SMAC 
	institutions. </p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "background-6">
	<h1 class = "background"> Solution </h1>
	
	<p> With the aforementioned problem, we would like to deliver a livelihood 
	program. It serves as a foundation for SMAC and its children. Our livelihood 
	program would deliver several services that can address the problem such as a 
	composting service and counseling assessments. This assures immediate 
	effectivity because of how this program would project a straightforward 
	initiative to help and address the needs of SMAC. And our livelihood program
	can also influence others to show their assistance and help. In terms of 
	alternatives, this solution is shown as more efficient because it would 
	guarantee effectivity, long terms effects, and propert application in 
	addressing the problem. All of the plans for the program would take time and 
	effort as any other program do, but with the members of our group, willing 
	associates and donors, and the guidance of our moderators these factors can 
	assist in making this program a success.  
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<!-- Project Significance --></!-->
	
	<div class = "significance-1">
	<h1 class = "background"> Rationale </h1>
	<p> The project delivers an innovative, community-safe, and beneficial program 
	that addresses the needs and issues of the community. It is vital because of 
	its initiative to provide a green space for the institution to contribute to 
	its resources and assist in the wellness and biodiversity of our communities.
	As well as a sacred space for equipping their spiritual needs, using for the 
	solace of prayer and supplication. Additionally, we aim to conduct healthy 
	conversational assessments for the children in SMAC. This would deliver a 
	widespread assessment that would reach the capacity of every child in their 
	residence. Aiming for a healthy mental condition we propose this program to 
	deliver conversational advice, webinars, as well as one on one discourse. 
	This would help in the development of the children and how it deals with their 
	issues and past traumas.     </p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "significance-2">
	<h1 class = "background"> Objectives </h1>
	<p> Our primary objective is to provide a safe, green space for the children 
	that would cater to their spiritual, mental, physical, emotional and social n
	eeds.
	<ol> 
	The specified points of this project are the following: 
	<li> To deliver a composting program.  </li>
	<li> Renovate a sacred space </li>
	<li> Construct green space all throughout the institution </li>
	<li>  Evaluate the condition of the children </li>
	<li> Provide an assessment program for all the children </li>
	<li> Succeed in establishing support for SMAC </li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "question-1"> 
	<h2 class = "background"> 1. Why is the project important for the institution? </h2>
	
	<p> The project is important for the institution because the facility was 
	going through a financial crisis and not being able to provide the necessary 
	services for the children who are living there and it might cause the children
	to suffer more not being able to get the basic services they need and for the 
	institution will continue to help the poor children as long as we will support 
	them and help them provide the necessary resources.</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class = "question-2"> 
	<h2 class = "background"> 2. Why is the project important for the ateneo students? </h2>
	
	<p> The students at Ateneo should take part in this research since it will 
	boost their own mental health and wellbeing. The students will understand more
	and think more deeply as a result of this. Additionally, this project does not 
	only benefit the institution but also the students of AdDu.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class = "question-3"> 
	<h2 class = "background"> 3. Why is the project important for the public in general? </h2>
	
	<p> As the project aims to assist the SMAC institution with the services that 
	it offers, the project is important for the public in general. This project 
	can encourage the public to volunteer and help the people in the institution. 
	Additionally, it can also inspire them to have a project of their own to help 
	other people.</p>
