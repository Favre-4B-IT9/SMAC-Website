	How will the two composting methods aid in the growth of the Abelmoschus esculentus (okra) seed?

<h3 class = "sip">Background and significance of the study</h3> 
<br>
<p class = "sip">
Composting enables the community to create additional food resources and reduces <br>
the likelihood of food shortages. People may engage in sustainability and urban gardening thanks to it. <br>
It also makes way for more environmentally friendly practices in our community. Composting is advantageous, <br>
so growing your own food, is a sustainable way to produce. With our composting project, <br>
we are contrasting two composting methods to see which is more useful for gardening. <br>
This will aid the institution in improving food production and addressing its food shortage. <br>

<h3 class = "sip">Review of related literature</h3>
<p class = "sip">
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (n.d.), The natural process of turning organic waste, such as leaves and food scraps, into a beneficial fertilizer that can improve soil and plants is known as composting. Composting merely expedites the decomposition process by creating the perfect environment for bacteria, fungi, and other decomposing organisms. Everything that grows eventually decomposes. By adding carbon to the soil, compost helps to enhance soil structure and gives plants nourishment.  
<br></br>
According to Contributor, G. S. F. (2020),  For this selected plant, the nutrients that it needs are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Potassium is essential for the yield of the vegetable and it increases the growth and production of the okra plant. Phosphorus enhances the plant growth, production, and quality of the okra. Lastly, Nitrogen also helps with growth but too much of it can result in excessive growth. This shows that in enhancing the growth of the okra, it is crucial to be careful with adding nutrients to the okra plant. 
<br></br>
Based on an article by Tanks Green Stuff (2019),  Yard waste and leaves are used in an aerobic on-site composting method that results in a straightforward yet efficient kind of compost, while Vegan compost uses fruit & vegetable scraps. The needed materials for Yard waste and leaves compost are twigs, wood chips, leaves, and grass. Nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are rich in fall leaves and vegetable scraps which helps give the Okra plant its needed nutrients.
<br></br>
According to Garden Tabs (2020), Vegan compost can also benefit the plant by contributing its nutrients to the soil and is generally odorless. Yard trash and leaves can be beneficial to the plant by providing it with the nutrients it needs, won't be damaging to the plant, and minimizing yard waste in an environmentally responsible method. In addition, vegan compost can also provide good drainage factors and suppress soil-borne diseases.

<div class = "treatments-1">
<h4 class = "sip">Treatment A</h4> <br>
<p class = "sip"> 
Treatment A consisting of the Food scraps compost. The materials that are incorporated into this compost are the following: ex. banana peels, cucumber peels, lettuce ends, eggshells, coffee grinds, etc. (can add more available materials that fit into the category) We need an amount of 160 grams of loam soil because the compost consists of 4 parts soil and 1 part compost materials. Add 40 grams of food scrap materials. Furthermore,  the total mixture should have 60% of its quantity in water in order to help in the decomposition process. So the volume of water needed for the compost is 120ml. It should be watered every 2 times a week., The compost will undergo its decomposition process in an average of 21 days or 3 weeks.<br> 
</div>
</p>

<div class = "treatments-2">
<h4 class = "sip">Treatment B</h4> <br>
<p class = "sip"> 
Compost made from yard waste and leftover paper product scraps is Treatment A. Here are some examples of the elements that comprise this compost: grass clippings, twigs, dried leaves, weeds, paper towels, tea bags, etc. (you can add additional readily accessible items that meet the category) We need 160 grams of loam soil since compost is made up of 4 parts soil and 1 part compost materials. Yard waste and paper product scraps totaling 40 grams should be included. Additionally, to aid in the breakdown process, the whole mixture should contain 60% water. As a result, 120ml of water is required for the compost. Water 2 times a week.  In a typical 21-day or 3-week period, the compost will begin to decompose. <br>

The control set-up will be identified as Set up A. The setup will have a measure of 700 grams of regular soi or loam soil in order to compare with the two other experimental setups as the controlled setup. Along with this, we have to add 3 seeds of okra. Add 50 ml of water to hydrate the plant every 3 times a week (25ml each) in the morning and afternoon. <br>

The experimental set-up will be identified as Set-up B.  The setup will have a measure of 200 grams of composted mixture of food scraps. Additionally, the composted mixture will be mixed with an amount of 500 grams of regular soil in order to assist in the decomposition process. Along with this, we have to add 3 seeds of okra. And add 50 ml of water to hydrate the plant every 3 times a week (25ml each)  in the morning and afternoon. <br>

Setup B will be used to refer to the experimental setup 2. 200 grams of a composted mixture of yard waste and paper product scraps will be used in the setup. In order to aid in the decomposition process, 500 grams of regular soil or loam soil will also be added to the composted mixture. We also need to put 3  okra seeds into the set up. Every 3 times a week (25ml each) in the morning and afternoon, add 50 ml of water to the plant to keep it hydrated. <br>
